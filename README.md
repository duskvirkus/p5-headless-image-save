# p5.js Headless Image Save

Run `npm start` to generate a screenshot of a p5.js sketch that is placed in the p5sketch folder. Uses [puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/) and requires chromium to be installed. Will probably work on servers like a digital ocean droplet but haven't tested it.

Thanks to @shiffman for the example sketch.
